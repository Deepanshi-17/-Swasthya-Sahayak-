## 🏥Swasthya-Sahayak (Healthcare-Provider Recommendation System)
Google Girl Hackathon - Ideathon Round Submission

## Overview

This project aims to develop a healthcare recommendation system to facilitate the process of finding and connecting with healthcare providers based on user-entered symptoms. Leveraging machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and web development technologies, the system offers personalized doctor recommendations tailored to individual healthcare needs.

## Features

- 🩺 **Symptom Analysis:** Machine learning algorithms analyze user-entered symptoms to identify potential health conditions. The system utilizes a dataset containing disease-symptom correlations to make accurate predictions.
  
- 📋**Doctor Recommendation:** Recommended doctors are matched with user symptoms based on specialties and availability. The recommendation engine prioritizes doctors with high ratings and aligned schedules to ensure quality and convenience for users.

- 🌍**Multilingual Support:** NLP techniques are employed to interpret and understand user inputs in multiple languages, enhancing accessibility for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

- 🖥️**User-Friendly Interface:** A web-based interface provides users with an intuitive platform to input symptoms, view recommended doctors, and provide feedback on the recommendations. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Prerequisites

- The latest version of Python installed on your system
